A simple iOS calculator app written in swift.
Enter your salary by hour and the price of a desired object and app will show how many hours you need to work to buy it.
Shows a currency symbol based on your region (doesn't work with regions where there is no currency symbol in Apple's database, e.g. Russia).
Also I added a simple unit test
